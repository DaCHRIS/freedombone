* Play Music
** With the DLNA service
An easy way to play music on any mobile device in your home is to use the DLNA service. Copy your music into a directory called "/Music/" on a USB thumb drive and then insert it into from socket on the Beaglebone.

ssh into the system with:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ssh myusername@mydomain.com -p 2222
#+END_SRC

Then mount the USB drive with:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
su
attach-music
#+END_SRC

The system will scan the Music directory, which could take a while if there are thousands of files, but you don't need to do anything further with the Beaglebone other than perhaps to log out by typing *exit* a couple of times.

If you have an Android device then go to F-Droid (if you don't already have it installed then it can be [[https://f-droid.org/][downloaded here]]) and search for *ControlDLNA*. On running the app you should see a red Debian icon which you can press on, then you may need to select "local". After a few seconds the list of albums or tracks should then appear and you can browse and play them.

The DLNA service will only work within your local home network, and isn't remotely accessible from other locations via the internet. That can be both a good and a bad thing. Another consideration is that there are no access controls on DLNA services, so any music or videos on the USB drive will be playable by anyone within your home network. If you need to restrict access to certain files then it may be better to use the music player within Owncloud.

** With Owncloud
The main advantage of playing music via Owncloud is that you can do that from anywhere - not only within your home network.

By default a music player is installed into Owncloud, so all you need to do is to visit your Owncloud web site, select the *music* directory and then upload some music files. Afterwards you can select the *music icon* from the top left drop down menu and albums will then appear which can be played. If you want to share music with other users then you can select the *share* option from within the files view to make the tracks available.
