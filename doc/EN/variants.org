Freedombone may be installed either in its entirety or as different variants with a more specialised purpose.  So for example if you just want to run a blog but don't care about any other services then you can do that. The following variants are available:

| *Mailbox*    | An email server with GPG encryption and mailing list                     |
| *Cloud*      | Share files, maintain a calendar and collaborate on document editing     |
| *Social*     | Social networking with Red Matrix and GNU Social                         |
| *Media*      | Runs media services such as DLNA to play music or videos on your devices |
| *Writer*     | Host your blog and wiki                                                  |
| *Chat*       | Encrypted IRC and XMPP services for one-to-one and many-to-many chat     |
| *Developer*  | Github-like system to host your software projects                        |
| *Nonmailbox* | Installs eveything except for the email server                           |
