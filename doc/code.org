Freedombone is really just a couple of [[http://www.gnu.org/software/bash][bash]] scripts which install and configure software on a Debian GNU/Linux system. If you're a system administrator, software engineer or Linux hobbyist you'll probably be familiar with command line scripting and be able to make your own modifications or custom variants to suit your needs. Freedombone is licensed under the [[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html][GNU General Public License version 3]].
