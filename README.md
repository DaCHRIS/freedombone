FreedomBone is a personal home communications server based upon the BeagleBone Black hardware. It's small and cheap and will allow you to use email, have your own web site and do social networking in a federated way without needing to rely upon any intermediary companies other than your ISP.

beaglebone.txt is in Emacs org-mode format.

If anyone wants to help on the project:

1. Suggest some quotations.  The idea of the quotations is to provide some extra inspiration in what otherwise would be a long boring process of typing in instructions.

2. Promote the idea of hosting your own internet services and resisting mass surveillance and censorship.  Encourage other people to set up their own Freedombone or similar home servers.  If you are a member of a club or organisation then set up a Freedombone for use by members.

3. If you know anything about computer security, encryption or filewalls then check the instructions and report any mistakes or improvements if you find them. That can be done via the Github issues. https://github.com/fuzzgun/freedombone/issues

4. If you think any of the systems are too vulnerable to security failings and shouldn't be recommended then flag that.

5. There are some deprecated instructions for systems which I havn't yet been able to get running. If you can improve those instructions to the extent that a working system is obtainable on Debian 7 then either submit a pull request or add the instructions as an issue.

6. I would like to include a liquid voting system for community or civic organisation. This goes beyond personal communications into the area of organising and developing a community (voting on things, making plans, delegating resources and people), and I think something like a Freedombox/Freedombone would be a good infrastructure for that. I havn't done much research on it but there are systems such as Liquid Feedback and Agora which would be good to include if possible. https://github.com/agoraciudadana/agora-ciudadana

5. It would also be nice to turn instructions into scripts, with the ultimate aim of being able to just type "apt-get install freedombone" and then enter some domain names and passwords. I think that's also a stated aim of the Freedombox project.
